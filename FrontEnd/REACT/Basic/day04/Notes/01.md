## UseEffect 

This hook is used to manage side effects of a component. It is similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. It runs after every render of the component. It takes a callback function as an argument. This callback function is called after every render of the component. 

```js
useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Ui rendered");
  });
```

## NOTES: 

- useEffect is called after every render of the component.

`if you want to prevent useEffect from running after every render, you can pass a second argument to useEffect function. This argument is an array of values. useEffect will only run if any of the value in the array changes.`



```js

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Ui rendered");
  },[count]);

// [] - is the second argument that contain the dependency array in which we pass the state variable that we want to watch for changes.
```

`if you pass any empty array as second argument, useEffect will only run once after the initial render of the component.`


```js
useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Ui rendered");
  },[]);
```

- handling cleanup in useEffect
   `it is a good practice to clean up any resources used by useEffect. For example, if you are using setInterval in useEffect, you should clear the interval in the cleanup function.`


```js

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Ui rendered");
    return ()=>{
      console.log("cleanup");
    }
  },[]);
```

There are two types of the component in react:

1. Functional Component
2. class-based component


There are very important life cycle methods in class-based components:

1. componentDidMount
2. componentDidUpdate
3. componentWillUnmount
