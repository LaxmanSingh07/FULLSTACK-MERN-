`How to handle the multiple states in React?`

- We can use multiple useState() hooks to handle multiple states in React.

Example:

```js
```


`Controlled Components`

(maintain state inside the component)

[source](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)

- In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

Example :

```js

```

`fieldset`
