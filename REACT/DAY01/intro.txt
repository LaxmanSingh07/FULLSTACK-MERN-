REACT ---> JS LIBRARY ---> UI CREATE

Magical line ---> React is all about components
what is component ---> reusable piece of code

imprative vs declarative --->
imprative ---> how to do something
declarative ---> what to do

why React --->
1. Virtual DOM ---> DOM is a tree structure
2. JSX ---> JS + HTML
3. Component based ---> reusable piece of code
4. One way data flow ---> data flows in one direction
5. Declarative ---> what to do
6. React Native ---> mobile app development

React is a library ---> not a framework

SPA ---> SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION
